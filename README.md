Implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbour (denoted k-NN) algorithm on a sub-sample of the Adult / Census Income data. 
The model is to predict if a person earns more than 50k (see "earns" attribute). 
A description of the attributes can be found from the UCI data repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult.

The results are being printed to a grid.results.txt
